# THIS IS A TEMPORARY COPY OF pr-scala-test script that does NOT assume that
# particular version of Scala has been published to Maven repo; previously
# that assumption allowed us to use published version of Scala as STARR
# This script has been created on 11/11/2014 and should go away as soon as
# we figure out how to publish to Maven repos again
# see also: https://groups.google.com/d/topic/scala-internals/5hHIkPiMTkk/discussion

# PRE:

#  - on pr maven repo: Scala version $maven_version_number
# OPTIONAL ENV VARS: 
#  - $testExtraArgs for any extra arguments to pass to ant
#  - $testTarget (default is test-opt)
